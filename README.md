## **What is CaloriSense?**

CaloriSense is an app where you can log your calorie intake daily 
using Gemma 3n with image recognition, running locally.
Logging your daily intake locally on the phone too! 
No need for the internet connection.

## How does my app work?
This is a simple flowchart of how my app works.

`Camera feed / A photo -> Gemma 3n -> Evaluate the meal -> Output the calorie`
